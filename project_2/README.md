# Ben Poh Project 2: Prediction of Housing Sale Prices

### Introduction

The data is from the Ames Assessorâ€™s Office used in computing assessed values for individual residential properties sold in Ames, IA from 2006 to 2010. It contains a range of **81 features** describing a property's characteristics. The target variable of this project will be 'SalePrice'.

### Problem Statement

You work for the local housing authority. Using the Ames housing dataset, your manager is keen to know how features of a property can determine its sale price. Your manager would also like to know if a better basement (size, quality, exposure etc.) will lead to a higher sale price.

### Datasets and Data Dictionary

#### Provided Data

There are two datasets included in the `datasets` folder. For the train dataset, I will be perfroming a further train/test split to get train/holdout sets to evaluate my models on (part 2). I will then be predicting sale prices from the test dataset by applying my model on the full train set again.

#### Data Dictionary

I have separated them into ordinal, nominal, discrete and continuous categories based on information from the [data dictionary](http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock/DataDocumentation.txt).

### Brief Summary Analysis

The project is split into two main parts (1) data cleaning/feature engineering, and (2) modelling using sklearn's `LinearRegression`, `Ridge` and `Lasso` models. 

To fulfil the project requirements, I also applied the model on a test set to predict 'SalePrice' and this was uploaded to a Kaggle competition.

A few key results/observations below:
   - A few variables (e.g. 'Overall_Qual','Gr_Liv_Area') have a good positive correlation with 'SalePrice'
   - The model works the best with a subset of 49 highly correlated features using the Linear Regression model
   - However, the Lasso and Ridge models performed quite similarly to the Linear Regression model
   - For the Kaggle competition, I chose the Lasso model with the 49 highly correlated features and obtained a RMSE of 27,849 on the public score.
   - To answer the problem statement, basement features provide a good association with 'SalePrice'
