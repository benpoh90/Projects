His wife mentioned that she was really worried about him after work stole his last two weekends. So we conspired. I begged him for help moving a large item I was picking up near him, and said I‚Äôd buy him lunch. His wife pressured him into taking the day off to help me. I told him to meet at the station with a set of work gloves for lifting a heavy item. Instead, I hired a [60th Anniversary F-Type]( (E-Type commemorative), and tossed him the keys.

pebymn,Proper-Compote-3423,2021-08-30 05:44:13,1,"TLDR at the bottom. After living overseas for ten years, I have returned to the UK for good. It‚Äôs been a long time coming, and I had been dreaming for months about the moment my parents got to meet my daughter. On Friday we landed at Heathrow after a very long journey - long haul flights with a baby are no joke! The early morning sun was shining. After a smooth taxi ride we arrived at my parents house where they were waiting in the driveway. I burst in to tears and couldn‚Äôt get any words out for a minute or two! To see them after so long and in good health was so lovely. Then they got to hold my daughter and properly begin their next chapter as grandparents. Background: my wife (then girlfriend) and I moved to Hong Kong ten years ago. We were 25 and 24 - we jumped on a plane with a suitcase each to begin what has been an amazing adventure. We traveled widely and saw so much. Thanks last two years saw us transition to a new stage in our lives - older, wiser - and now parenthood. The tough times in Hong Kong started in 2019 with widespread protests and civil unrest disrupting much of daily life. My wife had to worry about inhaling tear gas on her way to work while pregnant. Then came COVID. Hong Kong totally controlled any outbreak, but also put tight controls on the borders - if we left Hong Kong we‚Äôd have to quarantine in a hotel room for 3 weeks upon our return - not something we were willing to to with a baby. Non-residents we‚Äôre not allowed to visit so this meant we basically couldn‚Äôt see our parents. Furthermore, being confined to a single city for so long was quite depressing - it‚Äôs a tiny country. Birthdays and christmases were celebrated via Zoom. We watched on enviously as families reunited following the lifting of the UK lockdown. So we made the decision to move back permanently! The last few months have been so stressful arranging work transfers, shipping, accommodation, selling our stuff, finding UK accommodation, nurseries etc, negotiating COVID restrictions - I‚Äôm so proud of us for making it happen. The other thing I‚Äôd been dreaming of was sitting down on my parents sofa with a cup of tea and a chocolate hobnob. Can‚Äôt beat Britishness! TDLR: lived abroad for 10 years. Had baby 16 months ago. Couldn‚Äôt visit family or vice versa for 20 months. Returned back for good last Friday. Returned to UK for first time in 20 months. Parents met their granddaughter for the first time",445,0.9363

Anyway, she gave me some numbers to call, she is putting me in touch with someone who will help me sort out finances, she offered me help with food banks if we ever need them (I dont right now but just being offered that can be a relief), and she also told me if I feel I need to speak to her again to ask for her by name and she will be happy to follow up with me. I've had some really rubbish experiences with doctors from a young age (dismissive and condescending mainly) ((also hint why I waited 8 years before I spoke up about my anxiety)) and I just think this is so positive that I needed to share.

onzyd2,BunMama,2021-07-20 11:10:24,1,"Just wanted to offer some tips to everyone suffering right now, in our brick homes made to retain heat! We have to make sure that our house doesn't go much above 25^(o)C because we have house rabbits which are evolutionary shitarses - they're terrible at heat regulation because they're supposed to be sleeping underground in hot weather, and can get heat stroke very easily. (This is also a PSA to everyone with rabbits, particularly outside ones. Please move them into shade, give them a large run where they're able to move around to cool off, and provide plenty of fresh water! Also cucumber is a fantastic way to rehydrate bunnies!) The cat has multiple cool mats she migrates around, but the rabbits can't have them because they munch everything in sight. They get frozen 2l bottles of water they have the option of sitting near if they need to cool off. Also they have two bowls of water (much better for rabbits to drink from than those bottles!) one is normal water, the other gets ice cubes in it so they can have a lick as and when they want - don't make this the *only* option they have. To start with, I'd say the biggest help we have for the huge patio windows that face south is having an awning that we put out to its fullest, and keeps the greenhouse effect in check. We cut a good few degrees off the house with that. See also outside shutters (I'm planning on getting some for the other south-facing windows), but the awning was game-changing. Next, windows; closed up tight in the day with black-out thermal regulation curtains shut. Every day at 8:30AM ish. Yes, it sucks to have a dark house, but I'm sitting here in 22^(o)C right now! The moment it starts cooling off to being lower outside than inside, curtains and windows are opened full. We have mosquito netting over all of them as well, otherwise it would be mothageddon. All the windows that aren't a security risk to leave open all night are left open to vent the house of all the heat. We've managed to get down to 18^(o)C overnight this way! Also getting a good cross-wind is amazing; we've got an open plan living/dining room that goes front to back, and the box room is directly opposite the bathroom making a cross-wind upstairs. Fantastic for air flow! Most importantly; start doing these things the moment it starts getting hot. Brick is an excellent thermal mass that releases heat once it's been given a chance to warm up. I can feel the heat radiating off my south-facing walls in the evening as they release this stored heat, so it's best not to let it heat up too much if you can help it. Things I'm planning as and when they can be afforded/done; * Ceiling fan at the top of the stairs to draw heat away from the downstairs (also, query for those better knowledgeable than me; would it be worth having a skylight above/near said ceiling fan to let the hot air rise out?). * UV/solar reflecting film on windows (this probably first of all, TBH. The awning was so fantastic at reflecting heat I think this would be a good next step) * Painting the south side of the house white in the hopes it'll reflect some of the heat back. They do it in the med, might as well try it here! A lot of these are of course reliant on being able to make bigger changes to your home, back when I was renting the best we could do in our greenhouse-like south-facing flat with giant single-glazed bay window was stick up space blankets (those silver ones used to keep people warm) and look like a grow house. Worked a treat but we were kicked out by the landlord for it. Successfully managing to keep the house 4-6 degrees below outside temperatures, despite having massive south-facing windows and no AC!",669,0.9987

oipuse,Stabbycrabs83,2021-07-12 12:03:15,1,So an old employee of mine reached out last month on LinkedIn. He had been struggling for work for about a month and was reaching out in desperation. Knowing his skillet I linked him with a recruiter that I have a relationship that always recruits in my ex employees field. Turns out the timing was great and ex employee had a job offer less than 7 days later. It felt good but I didn't think much else of it until today. Bumped into the guy with his family and got a massive thanks from them all which was a little embarrassing given how enthusiastic it was in public. Anyway it turns out their bank accounts were on fumes with his wife not having work just now with young kids and they have gone from full blown worry to a stable family again. They even tried to take me into a shop to buy me a bottle of bourbon as they know I like it but I declined that as I was happy to have done the favour. Anyway a little reminder that doing something that feels small to you might have a massive effect on someone else. I also got a mail of thanks from the recruiter who filled a role quickly. A good day today :) Got a family thanks today,222,0.9881

The late royal was almost as known for her distinctive and often ground-breaking fashion choices, with several of her style moments now fairly labelled ""iconic"" - from the 'revenge dress', to the gown she wore to dance with John Travolta, to her world-famous wedding dress, designed by David and Elizabeth Emanuel.

Even with a terrible goal difference, England still have 1 point more than Ukraine and Finland. England are already through! The only question now is: do England play for a win and first place, or a draw and 2nd place. Winners of Group D will face one of the powerhouse teams of France / Germany / Portugal (whoever finishes 2nd in that group), but the second place team gets Sweden / Slovakia / Spain (whichever team finishes second there).

I was at my new job for 2 weeks then everything got locked down. It was a worrying time, and after those 2 weeks I knew the job wasn't for me. I had grown to hate retail but I fucked about in my younger years so didn't have any real qualifications. So the first month of lockdown was scary, not knowing where I was gonna be coming out of it. Always loved driving though. So I used my money to pay for my truck license and as soon as the first lockdown lifted I got through it all passing first time. Had a couple of driving jobs since, mostly agency to gain experience, but then the best thing happened. I applied for 7 jobs, I got 4 responses by midday the following day asking for me to come in. Went for 2 interviews and got offered both jobs. Didnt even bother with the other 2 as the one I really wanted, wanted me. Such a relief to be in this position after all that's gone on. Feel very lucky. To top it off, my partner, also in retail was very depressed as she also hated it..we just don't like other adults very much!.

Tried bump starting it with a little bit of success which got me a further mile up the road before it conked out again by a roundabout. I decided to push the bike on the path around the roundabout and attempt to bump start against no avail when a van pulled up to check on me. The guy owned his own motorcycle shop so had a quick look over it but said it wasn‚Äôt going to be rideable and stated the probable cause of the breakdown. He said he was heading in the other direction to where I needed to go, so he called up one of his employees to come and pick me and my bike up in another van and take me home, and to just sort him out a drink for his troubles. Fortunately I had broken down next to a pub who gave me some water (running down the road pushing a motorbike in a leather jacket in this heat is no fun), and the employee turned up about 20 minutes later (enough time to cool down). Loaded the bike onto the van, and away we went! Discussed the possible problems with the bike on the way home and was told it should be an easy fault find with a multimeter and hopefully an easy fix. Was home only 45 minutes later than normal. I gave the employee a bottle of rum for his troubles. So thank you Colin from Moore Speed Racing in Poole for stopping and helping arrange for me to get home, and thank you Tom for taking me home. Absolute legends! You have definitely acquired a customer for my next motorbike purchases! As an added bonus, I found out the problem with the bike (failed regulator/rectifier), fitted a new one, and it‚Äôs back on the road only a week later for the tidy sum of ¬£20 and a bottle of rum.

nud6d7,smilerlollie,2021-06-07 13:57:35,1,"So yesterday I helped a man on the M1 northbound. He was out of his car in the 3rd lane jumping about and waving his arms. His car had the hazard lights on. I slowed right down on approaching him and could not filter into the traffic either side of me. So I came to a total stop with my hazards on. A car stopped behind me also with hazards. There must have been over 100 cars between me seeing his car flashing and me stopping that did not stop or even slow down very much. This guy came upto me to tell me he had his kids in the car and it had broken down and he couldn‚Äôt move over - full running traffic and no hard shoulder anyway. I told him to get back in his car and I would stay where I was and keep my hazards on. I also rang the police to get the section of motorway either stopped or at least attended. He managed to start his car again, and with the help of myself and the car behind he could make it into the inside lane and to the next refuge about half a mile away. I followed slowly to get him to there and then drove off with just a pip of the horn and a wave. I‚Äôm not posting this as a boast but to remind/ask everyone driving on the motorways with no hard shoulder to keep an eye out for stranded cars and to effectively help each other out as much as we can.
