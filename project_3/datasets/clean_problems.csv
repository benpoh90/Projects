I personally didn't agree with this view cause not everyone goes to uni after school, but I was in a minority. I then asked some of my friends from school about what they thought, particularly the ones that didn't go to university, and they also said it's too weird for people beyond 24/25 to be in uni cause they'll stick out like a sore thumb and that university is basically for 18/19 years to get drunk and learn life skills.

Earlier today at Tesco, I would see people pack their shopping into their cars and then just literally leave the trolley where it is. Now, aside from the sheer laziness of this - particularly with their being (more than) enough trolley bays, it made things especially difficult for me in a wheelchair. I have to navigate around them; they can be very heavy when the wind blows them at you! As these trolleys block parking spaces, the next person would have to move it and I saw a few people muttering and shaking their heads before moving them out of the way, so they could park. Surely, simply returning it to the trolley bay would be the decent thing to do? Instead, they end up in bushes, hitting other cars and generally just being a hazard. Believe it or not, I saw one woman empty all the rubbish from her car into one after she packed her shopping. It looked like crisp packets, tin cans and old receipts. I really feel sorry for the people who will have to spend forever (and a day!) trying to retrieve these trolleys, so selfish. Does this happen where you are? Thank you.

I had somehow missed the 'Vegan' sticker and I am afraid I lack the garrulous verbosity to explicate how utterly ghastly said confections proved to be. The ice cream was completely tasteless. They were advertised as Red Berry and Chocolate but it tasted like tapwater sorbet. This lack of flavour actually became desirable when I got to the cone. Oh dear god, it was awful. Actually unpleasant tasting and a horrid texture. Do not under any circumstances buy these affronts to the good name of Ice Cream.

I got an invitation to attend a session. I went to it and it went well. They said they would email me, which they did. The exchange was perfectly courteous and went on for a few emails while we discussed funding. In the past I had been funded by the council, but wasn't anymore. They did have a bursary fund, but you had to - in their words - show that you tried every other avenue to get funding first. I wasn't prepared to do that, and I did not think I would be eligible anyway. So I very politely declined and said I'd have to leave it as I couldn't afford it, but good luck for the future and thanks for having me the past five years. Absolutely no response in reply. Just crickets. Not a ""good luck"" or ""it was nice having you"" in return. Soon as they realised I couldn't afford it, they literally couldn't care less.

Without the BBC, nobody would have taken a risk on The Office, Monty Python, etc. Despite what some people want to believe, they are also responsible for one of the least biased news networks in the world.

They produce tremendous documentaries, and even run educational programs for children. All for just £150 a year. People still complain. I reckon most people would miss the BBC if they were gone.

So for the pass two weeks, I've ripped up the old carpets and the laminate flooring below it, got an electrician to put in three double plug sockets with USB points as there was just a single plug socket in the whole room, repainted every wall white with four coats (they were all pink before). And reprinted the shirting-boards. All mainly on my hour lunch break while I'm working from home. We also needed a plasticer to fill in the holes left from the new plug sockets. We couldn't find a qualified plasticer so the wife got some training at work from a plasticer (she works on a building site.) And she did at the plasticing a couple of weekends ago. We were just replacing the curtain poles when the wife spotted A LEAK. She was just out the shower. It looks like there is a leak in the en-suite shower room. I did get the week off this week so I can decorate the dinner room, hallway and living room with the carpet fixers coming Monday morning 9am to fix the new carpet in the bedroom. We, just, managed to get hold of the carpet fitters to postpone it a few weeks and the insurance company. Both closed at 4pm on a Sunday. We discovered the leak at 345pm.

Whilst I'm here, I'll also do a quick overview of the rules. 1. **No posts about reddit (including other subreddits), this subreddit, and no changing or removing banned words in posts to avoid automod detection** \- this includes things changing Covid to C0vid. We're not thick, we spot this, and you will get permanently banned for it. If you think your post hasn't been done 100 times before and still contains a banned word let us know via modmail, we will likely approve it. 2. **Problems must be relatable to the wider British public (but not necessarily British in nature)** \- if the issue isn't predominantly about the UK, or doesn't contain a UK twist, it's not really for here. 3. **Submission titles must contain the entire problem** \- i.e. we hate clickbait. ""M&amp;S salads are great but ..."" is not OK, we also hate ellipses. Any clickbait esq title will result in a ban. 4. **No politics, policies, politicians, etc** \- as above really. If you feel the need to complain, go to r/ukpolitics instead 5. **No Slurrs or harassment** \- we've seen this crop up a bit recently for people simply not realising something is a slur, words like ""retard"" or ""libtard"" (any insult with the suffix 'tard') are slurs. Words like ""mongoloid"", are slurs. Pretty simple **do not use slurs.** We're british, so swearing etc is fine, just don't use slurs. 6. **No spam or surveys** \- if you want to ask a question, try r/AskUK, if you want to do a survey, try r/SampleSize, we're not here for your homework. 7. **No rants or problems specific to you** \- if it is specific to you, has only really happened to you (like a seriers of events that are seemingly random) we're not interested (unless its hilarious). Too many people are treating this place like Facebook or Twitter, and dumping their thoughts and specific problems onto the sub. 8. **No uncivil posts or comments** \- Don't be a prick, if you feel like something is getting into an argument or you're just dropping insults, step back, report the person, and stop engaging. We do not care who started it, if we come across it we'll just ban everyone involved. No Politics really does mean no politics &amp; other rules.",432,-0.9939
