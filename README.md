# Hi, I'm Ben ðŸ‘‹

### About Me

I am a recent graduate of General Assembly's Data Science Immersive course, a 12-week programme covering data analysis, statistical modelling, and machine learning algorithms (from regression models to deep learning neural networks).

This is a repository of the projects which I have completed during the course. For the final capstone project, I built an optical character recognition (OCR) tool to capture text data from coffee bean packaging labels, and then leveraged natural language processing (NLP) models to create a recommender system to suggest new coffee beans to buy from an online retailer.
